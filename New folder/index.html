            Grand Theft Auto 5 is a premium action game developed by Rockstar Games. Considered one of the best video games of the last decade, GTA V takes us back to Los Santos, the setting for the misadventures of CJ in the legendary GTA San Andreas. As is typical in the series, you can expect chaos, violence, and madness with plenty of political incorrectness in a sandbox game ten years after its original release. It is still as fresh and entertaining as it was on day one.
Loaded with new features and a map three times larger than its predecessor Grand Theft Auto IV, GTA 5 is one of Rockstar's most ambitious projects.
Three criminals in the pursuit of success
Grand Theft Auto V reinvents the sandbox genre with an ambitious story that, for the first time, is starred by three different main charactersâ€”Michael, Trevor, and Franklin. This atypical trio of misfits is undoubtedly one of the best features of this new GTA. With clashing personalities and unique gameplay abilities, this triad offers different perspectives that enrich the missions, plot development, and overall gaming experience. 
Thereâ€™s Michael De Santa, a former bank robber who worked with Trevor, committing all sorts of crimes. After betraying his partners and faking his death, Michael lives a fruitful and peaceful life in Los Santos... However, it's all a facade. Now in his forties, De Santa has a dysfunctional family led by a cheating wife and two ungrateful, spoiled children who burn whatâ€™s left of his fortune. Depressed and deeply in debt, Michael sees no other escape from his troubles than returning to his criminal roots.
Next is Franklin Clinton, a young Afro-American gangbanger who aspires to become something more and leave the suburbs where heâ€™s lived all his life. While waiting for his big break, Franklin works repossessing high-end cars for an automobile company with his friend Lamar. However, things change when he meets Michael, who recruits him to help in his bank robberies and quickly becomes a mentor figure to him.
Lastly, Trevor Philips is a former pilot and bank robber. After Michaelâ€™s betrayal, Trevor left for Blaine County and hid in Sandy Shores, where he ran a small but powerful drug dealing network. Chaotic and constantly crossing the line of sanity, Trevor is a psychotic man prone to sudden and violent outbursts. After discovering that Michael is still alive, he moves to Los Santos to join his partner and help him with his heists.
Time may have passed since its release in 2013, but thanks to the RAGE and Euphoria engines, Los Santos still looks as fresh and crisp as it did back then. Every corner of the city feels alive, showing off its unique 4K textures and jaw-dropping lighting effects. This is topped off by exceptional motion capture, bringing the cast to life with realistic expressions that fully immerse players in an unforgettable cinematic experience.

In terms of sound, the game has a memorable soundtrack with catchy themes that adapt to its different missions. The surround sound effects are excellent and make you feel like you are in the middle of a heist. While you drive in this game, you can enjoy songs from iconic bands such as Queen, Chicago, Black Eyed Peas, Def Leppard, Boston, and many more.
Record your adventures with the Rockstar editor
The PC version of GTA V comes with an exciting new featureâ€”the Rockstar Editor. This video editor allows you to record clips of your adventures in Los Santos and then tweak them as much as you want to create your motion picture. You can manipulate the camera, add depth of field and effects, and change the speed. You can turn any of your feats into the perfect movie. In addition to that, you can also add music from the different radio stations of the game as well as add text to your videos. Finally, you can export your creations to the Rockstar Social Club or upload them directly to your YouTube channel.
The worldâ€™s most excellent sandbox
The Grand Theft Auto series has always been known for allowing players to explore and do whatever they want across a massive map. In that aspect, GTA V does not disappoint. Whether visiting Los Santos, driving through Blaine County, or climbing Mount Chilliad, you wonâ€™t have time to get bored. Even though it takes around 33 hours to complete the main campaign, youâ€™ll spend hundreds more exploring the game. In addition to the main missions, the map has hundreds of secondary missions, each crazier and more challenging than the previous one. Thereâ€™s also hidden throughout the gameâ€”you will find secrets, activities, and mini-games that will bring you hours and hours of entertainment.
A robust multiplayer game
GTA 5 includes Grand Theft Auto Online Rockstarâ€™s most ambitious multiplayer experience. Youâ€™ll be able to experience your criminal adventures in San Andreas alongside up to 30 other players at once. Simply create your avatar and do anything necessary to achieve fortune and success. The game includes hundreds of activities such as missions, races, competitions against other players, and the possibility to create your gang to organize heists. The possibilities are infinite in a multiplayer as big and as fun as the gameâ€™s main campaign.
Los Santos Drug Wars
Los Santos Drug Wars introduces its thrilling conclusion, The Last Dose, which features five action-packed missions involving the Fooliganz, Dax, and a psychedelic conspiracy. Players can secure the new Ocelot Virtue supercar and take advantage of a massive rewards event. The Last Dose missions have players aiding the Fooliganz in their battle against shadowy opposition while also contending with potent psychedelics.
